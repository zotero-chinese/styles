This book deals with the problems of closed data and singular matrices in multiple discriminant analysis and classification procedure. Organized into 12 chapters, this volume begins with an overview of the petrological data that can be quantified, including both discrete and continuous variables. This text then examines the methods of testing for differences between the means of two populations. Other chapters consider the three methods of evaluating linear trends within such bivatiate plots, namely, the use of the correlation coefficient, linear regression analysis, and either structural or functional relationships. This book discusses as well the propagation of errors in mineral and normative recalculations. The final chapter deals with the use of computers to manage the tremendous amount of information that is available. This book is a valuable resource for petrologists, geochemists, and geologists.",

		"abstract": "The distribution of striated pavements, tillite, outwash deposits, faceted and striated stones, boulders preserved in laminated sequences and interpreted as dropped by ice floes, and other records, show that a large part of Australia was glaciated during the late Paleozoic. Alpine glaciers grew in the Carboniferous upon mountain ranges bordering the Tasman geosyncline in Queensland and northern New South Wales, beginning in the latest Namurian and culminating during the Westphalian and early Stephanian. Later, following deep erosion, continental ice sheets expanded at the end of the Carboniferous (latest Stephanian), and reached their maximum extent in the Early Permian (Sakmarian), when they spread across Tasmania, Victoria, South Australia, and much of New South Wales. They reached the Northern Territory in central Australia, and covered a large part of Western Australia, with centers in regions bordering the Perth, Carnarvon, Canning, Officer, and Bonaparte Gulf basins. A broad arcuate depression, at times occupied by the sea, crossed the continent from Western Australia, through central South Australia, and northeastward into Queensland. The ice sheets rapidly dwindled in the Artinskian; although in eastern Australia and Tasmania, large blocks were dropped into marine sediments from distant glaciers, continuing into the Late Permian (early Kazanian).The piecemeal stratigraphic record indicates that continental ice spread northeastward into Tasmania from highlands bordering the region on the southwest, and northward through glacial valleys along the coast of South Australia. The apparent source region is now under the deep ocean, but in the late Paleozoic was probably occupied by then-adjacent Antarctica. The spread northward of continental ice sheets at the end of the Carboniferous corresponds with a rapid shift of paleolatitude as determined from published paleomagnetic studies. Continental glaciers apparently grew when Gondwanaland moved near the South Pole and an unfrozen paleo-Pacific was close by to provide abundant moisture.",

		"abstract": "Lower and upper tills from the area along the north shore of Lake Erie were studied by various field and laboratory methods in order to determine which of them would be the most suitable for later and more detailed investigations. Where only differentiation of two tills is required the following methods were found to give the best results: determination of color and grain-size, petrographic analyses, particularly of the 0.5-1.0 mm grade, heavy mineral investigations and determination of carbonate content of the silt+clay grade. Where provenance is the dominant consideration field studies of till fabric and till stones (alignment of stones, orientation of pentagonal pebbles, striage on boulder pavements), petrographic investigation of sand and pebble grades, heavy mineral investigations, particle size analyses, and determination of carbonate content, seem to be most suitable as illustrated in this paper. Some preliminary conclusions are drawn in respect to provenance of the two tills and ice flow directions. The upper till has a higher percentage of local materials from the Lake Erie basin, such as Devonian shales and Pleistocene lacustrine deposits. This indicates an intensive erosion of the lake depression during the period of deposition of the upper till. Differences in the pre-Cambrian components of the two tills suggest that the earlier ice flow, depositing the lower till, came from north-northeast, but the later one, depositing the upper till, was along the Lake Ontario and Lake Erie basins.",

		"abstract": "Debris transported by glacier is derived either supraglacially from nunataks and valley sides or from erosion of the subglacial bed. Debris produced above the glacier by fracturing of rock walls has a dominant coarse fraction with angular boulders. Subsequent englacial or supraglacial transport is relatively passive and little comminution occurs. Debris eroded from subglacial bedrock is initially transported in a basal zone of traction, where particles frequently come into contact with the glacier bed and are retarded by it so that large forces may be generated between particles and the bed and at interparticle contacts. The material introduced into this tractional zone may be subglacial bedrock which has undergone a crushing-plucking event and which has a dominant coarse fraction, or supraglacially derived material which finds its way to the glacier bed. These parent debris assemblages are further comminuted by failure in response to locally concentrated compressive stresses, and attrition at shearing interfaces. Boulders transported through the tractional zone will tend to be rounded and bear several directions of striation. Large boulders embedded in lodgement till will tend to be streamlined with striae parallel to glacier flow and with an abruptly truncated distal extremity, rather like a roche moutonnée. Textural and boulder shape characteristics can be used to help distinguish different types of till.",
