  {"id":"andreaniAreCEOsRewarded2025","abstract":"Focusing on the one-off tax gains and losses (i.e., windfalls) associated with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we reexamine whether CEOs are rewarded for luck. We find that weakly monitored CEOs are compensated for the windfall tax gains but not penalized for the corresponding tax losses. No such pattern is observed for CEOs facing greater pay scrutiny. The pay for windfalls cannot be explained as rewards for CEOs’ efforts, talents, political activities, or as firms sharing their tax gains with all executives. The results are more consistent with rent extraction by CEOs facing weak pay scrutiny.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Andreani","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Ellahie","given":"Atif"},{"family":"Shivakumar","given":"Lakshmanan"}],"citation-key":"andreaniAreCEOsRewarded2025","container-title":"The Journal of Finance","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"jiangInvestorMemoryBiased2025","abstract":"We survey a large, representative sample of retail investors in China to elicit their memories of stock market investments and their return expectations. We merge these survey data with administrative transaction data to test a model in which investors selectively recall past experiences to form their beliefs. Our analysis uncovers new facts about investor memory and highlights similarity-based recall as a key mechanism of belief formation in financial markets. A rising market prompts investors to recall their past experiences more positively, leading to more optimistic forecasts of future returns. Recalled experiences can explain cross-investor variation in return expectations and, in our setting, dominate actual experiences in their explanatory power. In the transaction data, we confirm that recalled experiences are reflected in investors’ trading decisions through a belief channel.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Jiang","given":"Zhengyang"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Hongqi"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Cameron"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Hongjun"}],"citation-key":"jiangInvestorMemoryBiased2025","container-title":"The Quarterly Journal of Economics","container-title-short":"Q.
